# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## 1. Purpose
Our goal is to foster an open, welcoming, and harassment-free environment for everyone, regardless of background or identity.

## 2. Scope
This Code applies to all project spaces—GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, Slack, or in-person events—when someone is representing the project.

## 3. Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming, inclusive language  
* Respecting differing viewpoints and experiences  
* Accepting constructive criticism graciously  
* Focusing on what is best for the community

Unacceptable behavior includes:

* Harassment, insults, or discriminatory jokes  
* Publishing others’ private information without consent  
* Sustained disruptive behavior in discussions or code reviews

## 4. Enforcement
Instances of abusive behavior may be reported to the maintainer at **coreyleath10@gmail.com**. Complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy of reporters.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct may be removed from the project team.
