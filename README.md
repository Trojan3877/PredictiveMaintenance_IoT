> **PredictiveMaintenance IoT** is a production-ready reference stack that ingests high-frequency sensor data, engineers features on the edge, trains a real-time fault-prediction model, and exposes REST & gRPC endpoints for alerting.  
> Written in **C# /.NET 8**, containerized with **Docker → Helm → Kubernetes**, and instrumented via **Prometheus + OpenTelemetry**. Designed to satisfy the reliability, security, and observability requirements of Big-Tech and Big-AI FinTech environments.
