The **PredictiveMaintenance-IoT** architecture is a multi-agent, edge-compute system designed for real-time industrial telemetry analysis. It bridges the gap between traditional machine learning anomaly detection and generative AI reasoning. By deploying a heavily optimized, quantized Large Language Model (Microsoft Phi-3 Mini) directly to edge hardware, the system not only flags mechanical failures with sub-15ms latency but also generates deterministic, human-readable mitigation strategies for maintenance technicians without requiring a cloud round-trip.

```

### Quickstart and local validation

The supported local path should be reproducible from a clean checkout. The inferred stack for this repository is **Python with a FastAPI edge gateway and optional C++/llama.cpp bindings**.

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release && cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

If the project uses external services, model artifacts, cloud credentials, or private data, start them through documented local fixtures or mocks. Never place secrets or identifiable records in the repository.

### Research-style metrics and benchmarks

| Evidence | Required record |
|---|---|
| Correctness | Test command, commit SHA, runtime, and pass/fail result |
| Performance | Warm-up, sample count, concurrency, median, p95, p99, throughput, and memory |
| Data/model quality | Dataset version, split strategy, leakage controls, calibration, subgroup results, and uncertainty |
| Runtime | Image digest, health-check latency, resource limits, and rollback target |
| Security | Dependency, secret, SAST, container, and SBOM results |

A benchmark number belongs in a versioned artifact tied to a commit and hardware/runtime description. Engineering benchmarks must not be presented as clinical, financial, safety, or model-quality validation without the appropriate domain evidence.

### Extended Q&A

**What is production-ready for this repository?**  
A reproducible build, tested public contract, controlled configuration, observable runtime, documented security boundary, versioned artifacts, and a tested rollback path.

**What must remain explicit?**  
The intended use, excluded use, data/credential handling, model or algorithm limitations, and which metrics are measured versus aspirational.

**What should be completed next?**  
Use the linked production-readiness issue for this repository as the checklist. Resolve missing tests, deployment instructions, observability, supply-chain controls, and release evidence before attaching a production claim.


## Senior review follow-up: reproducibility and operating trade-offs

This section closes the documentation items tracked in [issue #6](https://github.com/CoreyLeath-code/PredictiveMaintenance_IoT/issues/6). The values below are the repository's existing simulated-edge benchmark results; they are engineering evidence, not a field safety certification.

### Verified evidence and clean-clone path

| Evidence | Current source of truth | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| Gateway throughput and p50/p99 latency | Empirical Performance Metrics above | Synthetic telemetry workload on the stated 4-core/8-GB environment |
| Failure-detection F1 | Empirical Performance Metrics above | Synthetic failure dataset; requires a versioned, representative plant dataset before deployment |
| Diagnostic TTFT, generation speed, and memory | Phi-3 Diagnostic Agent table above | CPU-bound quantized inference; not a machine-control deadline |
| Static quality and tests | `ruff check .`, `pytest tests/`, and `pytest tests/performance/` | Must be rerun from the commit under review |
| Runtime validation | `uvicorn src.api.main:app` plus the documented health/API checks | Requires the model artifact and local environment described in Quick Start |

From a clean checkout, run:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Linux/macOS: source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
ruff check .
pytest tests/
pytest tests/performance/
```

The README should only promote a new benchmark after the command, commit SHA, hardware, workload, warm-up policy, and raw result artifact are recorded together. Container size, image digest, secret/dependency scan output, and coverage percentage remain release evidence to capture in CI rather than inferred from badges.

### Engineering decisions and trade-offs

- **Local quantized inference vs. cloud reasoning:** keeping Phi-3 on the edge avoids a cloud round trip and supports disconnected sites, but consumes roughly 2.5 GB and makes model distribution and hardware compatibility operational concerns.
- **Fail-safe alerting vs. alert volume:** a conservative critical threshold protects recall for dangerous anomalies, while noisy sensors can increase false alarms; production rollout needs threshold calibration and technician-confirmed outcomes.
- **Asynchronous diagnostics vs. control-loop latency:** the lightweight detector owns the fast path; the LLM is advisory and must never be the sole actuator for a safety decision.
- **Next production step:** re-run the benchmark with a versioned representative dataset and signed model artifact, then add a hardware-in-the-loop failure-mode test before treating the reported latency or F1 as deployment evidence.


## Diagnostic safety boundary

The diagnostic service fails closed when the Phi-3 model artifact is unavailable: anomalous telemetry receives HTTP 503 and `GET /ready` is unready. The historical mock mitigation is available only when `ALLOW_MOCK_DIAGNOSTICS=true` is deliberately set for local development or CI. Do not enable that switch in a production deployment; mock text is not safety guidance.

## System Architecture & Multi-Agent Flow

The system operates on a dual-agent topology. A lightweight anomaly detection model serves as the primary gateway, processing continuous sensor streams. The LLM diagnostic agent is highly constrained and computationally isolated, executing only when a critical failure threshold is breached.

Here are a few extended Q&A pairs detailing the core functionality, architectural decisions, and edge-compute limitations of this repository.

1. Why use a quantized LLM (Phi-3) instead of calling an OpenAI or Groq API for diagnostics?
A: In industrial edge-compute environments—such as oil rigs, remote manufacturing plants, or autonomous vehicles—internet connectivity is often unstable, air-gapped for security, or severely bandwidth-constrained.

Relying on a cloud API introduces latency that is unacceptable when dealing with critical mechanical failures (like a runaway thermal event). By utilizing a 4-bit quantized version of Microsoft's Phi-3 Mini (3.8B parameters) via llama.cpp, the system runs completely offline. It fits comfortably within a ~2.5GB memory footprint, meaning it can generate deterministic mitigation plans directly on a local gateway device (e.g., an industrial Raspberry Pi or edge server) without ever leaving the facility's internal network.

2. What happens to the inference latency when the LLM is triggered? Does it block the primary anomaly detection?
A: No, it does not block the primary detection loop due to our dual-agent architectural design.

The primary anomaly classifier (Tier 1 of the multi-agent flow) is a lightweight machine learning model (e.g., a Random Forest or specialized neural net) that processes high-frequency telemetry in under 15ms.
The LLM (Phi-3) acts as a secondary diagnostic agent. It is completely bypassed during "Healthy" cycles. It only spins up its inference process when a "Critical" failure is predicted. While the LLM takes roughly 1.8 to 2.5 seconds to generate its mitigation text, this is acceptable because the mechanical system is already entering an emergency state, and the text is meant for human technicians, not millisecond-level machine control.

3. How does the 9-Tier CI/CD pipeline ensure the AI doesn't hallucinate dangerous instructions?
A: The "invisible hand" of our deployment hygiene pipeline enforces strict behavioral checks before the code is ever deployed to the edge.

First, Tier 2 (Integration Testing) feeds predefined critical anomalies (like high vibration) into the /diagnose endpoint and asserts that the LLM's text output actually contains expected technical directives (e.g., "Immediate Shutdown") and doesn't return empty or nonsensical strings.
Second, we enforce a strict temperature of 0.1 in our prompt engineering (documented in dialog.md), which drastically reduces the model's creative variance.
Finally, Tier 8 (Canary Deployments) routes a small percentage of live telemetry to the new model in a secure sandbox, monitoring its Time-to-First-Token and error rates before full production rollout.

4. The test_api.py file was throwing F401 Ruff errors earlier. Why is the pipeline so strict about unused imports?
A: In enterprise MLOps, code hygiene is a critical security and performance vector. Unused imports (like import os or import numpy) are not just "messy"; they can obscure supply chain attacks, unnecessarily bloat Docker containers, and confuse peer reviewers.

By enforcing Ruff linting at Tier 1 (Static Analysis), the pipeline automatically blocks Pull Requests that contain sloppy code. It forces the developer to clean up their test files before the system spends compute resources building containers or running complex integration benchmarks. This ensures the main branch remains a pristine, portfolio-grade artifact.
